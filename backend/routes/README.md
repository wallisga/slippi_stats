## Architecture

This project follows a **modular architecture** with clear separation of concerns:

### Backend Architecture
- **Lightweight Flask App** with application factory pattern
- **Blueprint-based Routing** organized by functionality (web, api, static, errors)
- **Service-oriented Business Logic** separated into web and API services
- **External SQL Management** with dynamic query discovery and template support
- **Pure Data Access Layer** with no business logic mixing

For detailed backend architecture, see [backend/README.md](backend/README.md)

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component-based Design** with self-contained packages
- **Template Inheritance** following base â†’ layout â†’ page pattern
- **Asset Management** where components own their CSS/JS
- **Bootstrap Integration** with modern responsive design

For detailed frontend architecture, see [frontend/README.md](frontend/README.md)

### Routes Architecture
- **Blueprint Organization** separating web pages, API endpoints, and static files
- **Thin Route Handlers** with business logic delegated to service layers
- **Authentication & Rate Limiting** implemented as decorators
- **Comprehensive Error Handling** with user-friendly error pages

For detailed routes architecture, see [backend/routes/README.md](backend/routes/README.md)

## Features

## API Documentation

### Player Endpoints
- `GET /api/player/{code}/stats` - Basic player statistics
- `GET /api/player/{code}/games` - Paginated game history
- `POST /api/player/{code}/detailed` - Advanced filtering and analysis

### Data Endpoints  
- `POST /api/games/upload` - Upload game data (supports legacy and combined formats)
- `POST /api/files/upload` - Upload replay files with metadata
- `GET /api/files` - List uploaded files
- `GET /api/files/{id}` - Get file details
- `GET /api/stats` - Server statistics and health
- `POST /api/clients/register` - Client registration

### Authentication
All data modification endpoints require API key authentication via `X-API-Key` header.

## Configuration

### Development
For development, the application uses sensible defaults. No additional configuration required.

### Production
Set environment variables for production deployment:
```bash
export FLASK_ENV=production
export SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
export SLIPPI_REGISTRATION_SECRET=your-registration-secret
export DATABASE_PATH=/path/to/production.db
```

## Database Schema
- **clients**: Registered client applications with metadata
- **games**: Individual game records with JSON player data  
- **api_keys**: Authentication tokens for API access
- **files**: Uploaded replay files with metadata and hash tracking

All SQL queries are managed through external .sql files for better maintainability and version control.

## Development Status

## Contributing

### Development Guidelines
- **Backend**: Follow the established service layer pattern and module import hierarchy
- **Routes**: Use blueprint organization with thin handlers delegating to services
- **SQL**: Add new queries as external .sql files in appropriate categories
- **Frontend**: Use the component-based architecture with self-contained packages
- **Code Style**: Follow PEP 8 for Python, component patterns for frontend
- **Testing**: Database functions should be testable with in-memory SQLite
