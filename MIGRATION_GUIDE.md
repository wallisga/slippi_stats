# Migration Guide: From Monolith to Service-Oriented Architecture

This document chronicles the successful refactoring journey of Slippi Stats Server from a monolithic application to a modern, service-oriented architecture. It serves as both a historical record and a guide for similar refactoring efforts.

## Overview

The migration transformed a **500+ line monolithic Flask application** into a **clean, testable, service-oriented architecture** with external SQL management and component-based frontend. This was achieved while maintaining **100% backward compatibility** and **zero downtime**.

## Pre-Migration State (Legacy)

### Problems with Monolithic Architecture

#### **Single Large File (`app.py` - 500+ lines)**
```python
# Everything mixed together in one file
@app.route('/player/<code>')
def player_profile(code):
    # Input validation mixed with business logic
    if not code or len(code) < 3:
        return "Invalid player code", 400
    
    # Direct database access with embedded SQL
    conn = sqlite3.connect('data/slippi_stats.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("""
        SELECT games.*, 
               json_extract(player_data, '$[0].player_tag') as p1_tag,
               json_extract(player_data, '$[1].player_tag') as p2_tag
        FROM games 
        WHERE json_extract(player_data, '$[0].player_tag') = ? 
           OR json_extract(player_data, '$[1].player_tag') = ?
        ORDER BY start_time DESC LIMIT 50
    """, (code, code))
    
    # Data processing mixed with presentation logic
    games = []
    for row in cursor.fetchall():
        # Complex data transformation inline
        player_data = json.loads(row['player_data'])
        # ... 50+ lines of data processing ...
    
    # Template rendering with inconsistent context
    return render_template('player.html', 
                         games=games, 
                         player_code=code,
                         # Inconsistent context structure
                         )
```

#### **Key Problems Identified:**
- **Mixed Concerns**: HTTP handling, business logic, and data access all in one place
- **Embedded SQL**: Database queries scattered as strings throughout Python code
- **Tight Coupling**: Changes to one feature often broke unrelated functionality
- **Difficult Testing**: Monolithic structure made unit testing nearly impossible
- **Poor Maintainability**: No clear boundaries between different responsibilities
- **Duplication**: Similar logic repeated across multiple endpoints
- **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Different error patterns throughout the application

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation & Configuration ✅
**Goal**: Establish modular foundation while maintaining existing functionality

#### **Actions Taken:**
1. **Extracted Configuration (`config.py`)**
   - Centralized all environment variables and settings
   - Created singleton configuration pattern
   - Added logging configuration and validation

2. **Modularized Database Access (`database.py`)**
   - Moved all database operations to dedicated module
   - Maintained existing SQL patterns temporarily
   - Added connection management and error handling

3. **Preserved Backward Compatibility**
   - All existing endpoints continued to work
   - No changes to external APIs or user interfaces
   - Gradual migration approach with rollback capability

#### **Results:**
- ✅ Reduced `app.py` from 500+ lines to 300+ lines
- ✅ Centralized configuration management
- ✅ Improved error handling and logging
- ✅ Zero downtime during migration

### Phase 2: Service Layer Extraction ✅
**Goal**: Separate business logic from HTTP handling

#### **Actions Taken:**
1. **Created Service Modules**
   - `web_service.py`: Business logic for HTML page rendering
   - `api_service.py`: Business logic for JSON API responses
   - `utils.py`: Shared data processing functions

2. **Refactored Route Handlers**
   - Made routes thin controllers that delegate to services
   - Standardized error handling patterns
   - Consistent response formatting

3. **Established Import Hierarchy**
   - Enforced strict import rules to prevent circular dependencies
   - Services can import database, utils, config
   - Routes delegate to services only

#### **Before/After Comparison:**

**Before (Monolithic Route):**
```python
@app.route('/player/<code>')
def player_profile(code):
    # 80+ lines of mixed logic
    # Database access
    # Data processing  
    # Error handling
    # Template rendering
```

**After (Service-Oriented Route):**
```python
@web_bp.route('/player/<encoded_player_code>')
@trace_endpoint
def player_profile(encoded_player_code):
    try:
        player_code = decode_player_tag(encoded_player_code)
        context_data = web_service.get_player_profile_context(player_code)
        return render_template('pages/player/player.html', **context_data)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error loading player profile: {str(e)}")
        return render_template('pages/error/error.html'), 500
```

#### **Results:**
- ✅ Reduced `app.py` from 300+ lines to 100+ lines
- ✅ Clear separation between HTTP handling and business logic
- ✅ Testable service functions with clear contracts
- ✅ Consistent error handling across all endpoints

### Phase 3: Blueprint Organization ✅
**Goal**: Organize routes into focused, modular blueprints

#### **Actions Taken:**
1. **Created Blueprint Structure**
   - `web_routes.py`: HTML page endpoints
   - `api_routes.py`: JSON API endpoints
   - `static_routes.py`: File serving
   - `error_handlers.py`: HTTP error handling

2. **Blueprint Registration System**
   - Centralized blueprint registration in `routes/__init__.py`
   - Consistent URL prefixes and patterns
   - Modular error handling registration

3. **Observability Integration**
   - Added OpenTelemetry tracing decorators
   - Implemented custom metrics for business events
   - Structured logging throughout all layers

#### **Results:**
- ✅ Reduced `app.py` to lightweight entry point (40 lines)
- ✅ Modular route organization with clear responsibilities
- ✅ Comprehensive observability and monitoring
- ✅ Easy to add new endpoints following established patterns

### Phase 4: SQL Externalization ✅
**Goal**: Move all SQL queries to external, organized files

#### **Actions Taken:**
1. **Created SQL Directory Structure**
   ```
   backend/sql/
   ├── schema/     # Database structure
   ├── games/      # Game operations
   ├── clients/    # Client management
   ├── api_keys/   # Authentication
   ├── files/      # File operations
   └── stats/      # Analytics queries
   ```

2. **Built SQL Manager System**
   - Dynamic discovery of SQL files
   - Template variable substitution
   - Query caching and hot reloading
   - Category-based organization

3. **Migrated All Embedded SQL**
   - Extracted 50+ SQL queries from Python code
   - Organized queries by functionality
   - Added template support for dynamic queries

#### **Before/After Comparison:**

**Before (Embedded SQL):**
```python
def get_player_games(player_code, limit=50):
    conn = sqlite3.connect('data/slippi_stats.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("""
        SELECT games.*, 
               json_extract(player_data, '$[0].player_tag') as p1_tag,
               json_extract(player_data, '$[1].player_tag') as p2_tag,
               json_extract(player_data, '$[0].character_name') as p1_char,
               json_extract(player_data, '$[1].character_name') as p2_char
        FROM games 
        WHERE json_extract(player_data, '$[0].player_tag') = ? 
           OR json_extract(player_data, '$[1].player_tag') = ?
        ORDER BY start_time DESC 
        LIMIT ?
    """, (player_code, player_code, limit))
    return cursor.fetchall()
```

**After (External SQL):**
```python
# backend/sql/games/select_by_player.sql
SELECT games.*, 
       json_extract(player_data, '$[0].player_tag') as p1_tag,
       json_extract(player_data, '$[1].player_tag') as p2_tag,
       json_extract(player_data, '$[0].character_name') as p1_char,
       json_extract(player_data, '$[1].character_name') as p2_char
FROM games 
WHERE json_extract(player_data, '$[0].player_tag') = ? 
   OR json_extract(player_data, '$[1].player_tag') = ?
ORDER BY {order_by} {order_direction}
LIMIT {limit_count}

# backend/database.py
def get_player_games(player_code, limit=50, order_by='start_time', order_direction='DESC'):
    query = sql_manager.format_query('games', 'select_by_player',
                                    order_by=order_by,
                                    order_direction=order_direction,
                                    limit_count=limit)
    with db_manager.get_connection() as conn:
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute(query, (player_code, player_code))
        return cursor.fetchall()
```
