## Architecture

This project follows a **modular architecture** with clear separation of concerns:

### Backend Architecture
- **Flask Application** with service-oriented design
- **Component-based Business Logic** separated into web and API services
- **Pure Data Access Layer** with no business logic mixing
- **Shared Utilities** for common functionality across services

For detailed backend architecture, see [backend/README.md](backend/README.md)

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component-based Design** with self-contained packages
- **Template Inheritance** following base â†’ layout â†’ page pattern
- **Asset Management** where components own their CSS/JS
- **Bootstrap Integration** with modern responsive design

For detailed frontend architecture, see [frontend/README.md](frontend/README.md)

## Features

### Player Analytics
- **Basic Profiles**: Win rates, character usage, recent games, performance highlights
- **Detailed Analysis**: Advanced filtering by character, opponent, and matchup
- **Performance Trends**: Time-series charts showing improvement over time
- **Character Statistics**: Win rates and usage patterns for each character
- **Rival Detection**: Identifies frequent opponents and challenging matchups

### Data Management
- **Automated Collection**: Client applications upload replay data automatically
- **API Authentication**: Secure API key system for client access
- **Flexible Storage**: SQLite database with JSON player data for flexibility
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive validation and error handling

### User Experience
- **Responsive Design**: Bootstrap-based UI that works on all devices
- **Character Icons**: Visual character representations throughout the interface
- **Interactive Charts**: Chart.js powered visualizations with drill-down capabilities
- **Smart Search**: Flexible player search with case-insensitive matching

## API Documentation

### Player Endpoints
- `GET /api/player/{code}/stats` - Basic player statistics
- `GET /api/player/{code}/games` - Paginated game history
- `POST /api/player/{code}/detailed` - Advanced filtering and analysis

### Data Endpoints  
- `POST /api/games/upload` - Upload game data (requires API key)
- `GET /api/stats` - Server statistics and health
- `POST /api/clients/register` - Client registration

### Authentication
All data modification endpoints require API key authentication via `X-API-Key` header.

## Configuration

### Development
For development, the application uses sensible defaults. No additional configuration required.

### Production
Set environment variables for production deployment:
```bash
export FLASK_ENV=production
export SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
export SLIPPI_REGISTRATION_SECRET=your-registration-secret
export DATABASE_PATH=/path/to/production.db
```

## Database Schema
- **clients**: Registered client applications with metadata
- **games**: Individual game records with JSON player data  
- **api_keys**: Authentication tokens for API access

## Development Status

### âœ… Completed
- **Backend Architecture**: Clean service-oriented design with separation of concerns
- **Database Layer**: Pure data access with comprehensive CRUD operations
- **Business Logic**: Separated into web and API service layers
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized with environment variable support
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and user feedback

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- **Frontend Component System**: Migrating to component-based architecture
- **Documentation Restructuring**: Decoupling architecture documentation

### ðŸ“‹ Planned
- **Advanced Analytics**: Enhanced matchup analysis and player comparison tools
- **Performance Optimization**: Database query optimization and caching
- **Export Features**: Statistics export and tournament bracket system

## Contributing

### Development Guidelines
- **Backend**: Follow the established service layer pattern and module import hierarchy
- **Frontend**: Use the component-based architecture with self-contained packages
- **Code Style**: Follow PEP 8 for Python, component patterns for frontend
- **Testing**: Database functions should be testable with in-memory SQLite
